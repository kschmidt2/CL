    <section class="slide-item">I’m a journalist. A designer. An interactive developer. A news nerd. Some might say a <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/calling-all-platypuses/" target"blank">platypus</a>.</section>
    <section class="slide-item"></section>
    <section class="slide-item">I’m currently a graphics editor at The Wall Street Journal. I’ve done a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/high-school-football-uncertain-future/" target="blank">few</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/markets-election-anniversary/" target="blank">interactive</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-banks-lost-the-battle-for-power-on-wall-street-1536312634" target="blank">projects</a>. But mostly I create print charts for the Money & Investing section of the paper.</section>
    <section class="slide-item"></section>
    <section class="slide-item">I’m looking to move into an interactive news design role where I could have a larger impact on the overall publication. I spent five years as a newspaper designer before heading to the University of North Carolina to study interactive journalism, where I focused on design and data visualization.</section>
    <section class="slide-item">One of my biggest motivators for going to graduate school was to expand my skills in order to gain career options outside of journalism. But going through the graduate program, studying the media more closely and expanding my skill set only reinforced how much I want to work in news.</section>
    <section class="slide-item">I’m deeply invested in the future of journalism. I regularly think about where the industry is headed and how we can make online news sustainable. My news industry folder on <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/u" target="blank">Instapaper</a> contains 103 articles that I’ve read and saved.</section>
    <section class="slide-item"></section>
    <section class="slide-item">I also spent a year researching, writing, designing, and developing my <a href="http://kierstenschmidt.com/no-news-is-bad-news/" target="blank">master’s thesis project</a> on the political implications of the shrinking newspaper industry (spoiler: they’re not good!).</section>
    <section class="slide-item">I’m not a business person. I’ve never worked on the business side of a media company. Between my two degrees, I took one business course (it was entrepreneurship). But I can help the news industry through design. Good web design <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/sectionii/S0148296302003533" target="blank">improves user loyalty</a> and, most critically to news organizations, trust and credibility. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.94.3917&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="blank">Multiple</a> <a href="http://makinggood.ac.nz/media/1276/robinsholmes_2008_aestheticsandcredibilityinwebdesign.pdf" target="blank">studies</a> have found that internet users make credibility judgments on the basis of presentation and aesthetics. (yes, I wrote a research proposal on this subject).</section>
    <section class="slide-item"></section>
    <section class="slide-item">Something about poorly designed news websites vs good ones and how I can make Ceros look good.</section>
    <section class="slide-item">I first heard of Ceros Originals two weeks ago in the <a href="https://us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5c12dabe1e59a9fbde1174b8c&id=e27a48af53" target="blank">Best in Digital Storytelling</a> newsletter, which linked to the visual analysis of diversity of magazine covers. I was impressed, and also confused as to why I had never seen this site before. I spent time reading various features on the site, then headed to the about us and jobs pages. I was thrilled when I saw you were looking for an editorial art director.</section>
    <section class="slide-item">I’d love the opportunity to work for an organization that not only places great value on visual storytelling, but helps others do it as well. I hope you give me the opportunity to show you how I can contribute to your journalism.</section>
    <section class="slide-item">Sincerely, <h2>Kiersten Schmidt</h2></section>
