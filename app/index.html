    <h1>hi there, I'm kiersten.</h1>
    <p class="slide-item">I’m a journalist. A designer. An interactive developer. A news nerd. Some might say a <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/calling-all-platypuses/" target"blank">platypus</a>.</p>
    <p class="slide-item">I’m currently a graphics editor at The Wall Street Journal. I’ve done a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/high-school-football-uncertain-future/" target="blank">few</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/markets-election-anniversary/" target="blank">interactive</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-banks-lost-the-battle-for-power-on-wall-street-1536312634" target="blank">projects</a>. But mostly I create print charts for the Money & Investing section of the paper. </p>
    <p class="slide-item">I’m looking to move into an interactive news design role where I could have a larger impact on the overall publication. My background is in editorial design. I spent five years as a newspaper designer before I headed to the University of North Carolina to study interactive journalism, with a focus on design and data visualization. </p>
    <p class="slide-item">I decided to go for my Masters for many reasons, but one of the biggest motivators was to expand my skills to more easily move top job outside of journalism. But going through the graduate program, studying the media more closely and expanding my skill set only reinforced how much I want to work in news. </p>
    <p class="slide-item">I’m deeply invested in the future of journalism. (My Instapaper news industry folder) My Masters thesis project was an interactive presentation on the political implications of the shrinking newspaper industry (spoiler: they’re not good!).</p>
    <p class="slide-item">Something about using design to help news here. Good web design improves user loyalty and, most critically to news organizations, trust and credibility (I wrote a research proposal on this subject).</p>
    <p class="slide-item">Going into ceros and how I can help. </p>
